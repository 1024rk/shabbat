# shabbat

## SHAred BATteries for Python modules, libraries and frameworks, written and used by C-System company.

## Installing

Don't install this module into system Python. Instead, add it to your `poetry` package management system:

### Disclaimer

Disregard the naming, this module isn't really created by Jews, so it works on Saturday just as fine as on any other day of week.
